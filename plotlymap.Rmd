## Creating a web page presentation using R markdown and plotly
This assignment uses the diamonds data from plotly in order to reconstruct the plots relating price to carat from a sample of 3000 diamonds. This will then be converted into an html page and hosted on githubs.

## Date: 2 February 2019
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
set.seed(36)
library(plotly)
d <-diamonds[sample(nrow(diamonds), 3000), ]
p <- ggplot(data = d, aes(x=carat, y = price)) + 
         geom_point(aes(text = paste("Clarity:", clarity)),
                    size = 4) + 
         geom_smooth(aes(color = cut, fill = cut)) + facet_wrap(~ cut)
print(p)
```
